 <p id="change" style="text-align:center;font-size:24px;display:block;font-family:Garamond;"><span class="left">Sucidal Thoughts or an attempt is an indication something is severely wrong in a person’s life.</span><br>
    Depression is the most common mental health condition for a person's decision to die by suicide. It can
make people feel high levels of emotional pain and loss of hope, unabling them to seek any another way to find relief other than ending their own life.<br>
 Hopelessness, either in the short-term or as a longer-lasting trait, has been found in many studies to contribute to suicidal
ideation. And higher the person's degree of hopelessness, the greater the lethality of their suicide attempt.<br>
 Another reason A person may decide to end their own life when facing a loss or the fear of a loss. 
 Sometimes people who feel suicidal may not even realize they are depressed. They're unaware that it is the depression — not the situation —
that's influencing them to see things in a "there's no way out," "it will never get better," "there's nothing I can do" kind of way.
Cry for Help- Sometimes people attempt suicide not so much because they really want to die, but because they simply don't know how to
get help. In parasuicied cases, suicide attempts become a way to demonstrate to the world just how much they are hurting.
Suicide Is Not Always Planned:- Many times, though, suicide attempts happen impulsively, in a moment of feeling
desperately upset.Sometimes a depressed person plans a suicide in advance.Some people who attempt suicide mean to die and some aren't completely sure they want to die. For some, a suicide attempt is a way to express
deep emotional pain.Besides their depressive effects, alcohol and drugs affect a person's judgment.Due to which, these
conditions — especially both together — increase a person's risk for suicide.<br>Most teens interviewed after making a suicide attempt say that they did it because they were trying to escape from a situation that seemed
impossible to deal with or to get relief from really bad thoughts or feelings. They didn't want to die as much as they wanted to escape from what
was going on. And at that particular moment dying seemed like the only way out.
